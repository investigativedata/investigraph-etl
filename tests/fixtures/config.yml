title: European Commission - Meetings with interest representatives
prefix: ec
country: eu
summary: |
  The Commission applies strict rules on transparency concerning its contacts
  and relations with interest representatives: it requires all its Members, their
  closest advisors (members of Cabinet) and all Directors-General to meet only
  interest representatives that are registered in the Transparency Register and
  to publish information on such meetings. Those measures fall within the
  meaning and scope of the conditionality and complementary transparency
  measures provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement establishing the
  mandatory Transparency Register.
